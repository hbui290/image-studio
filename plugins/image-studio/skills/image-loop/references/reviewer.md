# Reviewer setup and limitations

## Requirements

`review.py` takes exactly one reviewer: `--model <vision model>` calls Codex; `--report report.json` uses a report already written by the Claude Code `image-reviewer` agent or a person and makes no model call.

- An image-enabled host agent/tool for generation and editing. The review script does not generate images.
- Python 3, Pillow, and jsonschema. Examples use `uv run --with pillow --with jsonschema python ...`; a virtual environment with those packages also works.
- For `--model`: an authenticated Codex CLI and an explicit reviewer model that accepts images on **your configured route**. Verify with an actual image review. A model appearing in a catalog is not proof that a given account/backend can execute it.

Keep the existing CLI provider configuration. The adapter uses it without editing it. It requests a read-only, ephemeral execution and instructs the reviewer to use only the attached images and brief. User-installed CLI skills/configuration may add context and usage; this is not a hermetically isolated inference call.

The test setup found GPT-5.6 Luna executable through its configured CLI. A preliminary `--ignore-user-config` GPT-5.4 Mini probe was rejected by the direct ChatGPT backend. That is evidence about this route, not a universal model-availability claim. Consult the example reports for the actual models used.

If the reviewer requires authentication, use the host's normal login process. Never paste credentials into a prompt, brief, repository, or report. The adapter does not copy credentials or write global configuration. Existing account usage is consumed; no dollar savings are inferred from the model name.

## Run one round

```bash
uv run --with pillow --with jsonschema python plugins/image-studio/skills/image-loop/scripts/review.py \
  --brief examples/product/brief.json \
  --source examples/product/source.png \
  --candidate examples/product/source.png \
  --out work/product-round-0 --model gpt-5.6-luna
```

This intentionally reviews the unchanged source against the requested revision, which should identify missing edits. It is a controlled revision test, not a claim of generation failure.

For an actual candidate, supply that file with `--candidate`. For the next round add `--previous work/product-round-0/report.json --repairs-used 1`. The original source remains the reference for protected criteria. Never feed the numbered annotation copy as the clean source.

## Files

- `report.json`: criterion-by-criterion independent visual review.
- `file-checks.json`: decoded dimensions, format, transparency evidence, and candidate SHA-256.
- `decision.json`: deterministic controller outcome.
- `repair-prompt.txt`: generated only when a repair is warranted.
- `reviewer-prompt.txt`: exact prompt used with attached images.
- `run.json`: requested model, account usage as exposed, elapsed time, image hashes, and retry settings. Dollar cost remains unknown unless independently calculated.
- `.private/`: CLI diagnostics, excluded from publication. These can include local paths and installed skill metadata; do not upload them unreviewed.

The script refuses to overwrite a previous round. Invalid output, missing IDs, duplicate IDs, uncertainty, provider failure, and failed file checks stop acceptance. Limits: at most three repairs by default; repeated identical failure sets escalate. The host agent must keep the repair count and previous-report chain accurate and retain the best protected candidate.

## What the reviewer can and cannot establish

Use vision for visible content, arrangement, local color appearance, and comparison. Use appropriate file/pixel tools for exact dimensions, alpha, and pixel identity. Use a stronger model or a person for uncertainty. Do not infer hidden layers or exact font families. Review small text and ambiguous arrows at adequate resolution; crops must be associated with the full image and original coordinates.

This protocol is motivated by known [vision limitations](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/images-vision#limitations). Prompting follows [OpenAI's image prompting guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-prompting). Image tools may hide their underlying generator model; record the tool name and leave unexposed model identifiers unknown.
